# Create a reading-notes Repo

Give yourself a learning challenge: Figure out how to publish a GitHub Pages web site, to use as a reading-notes.

## Setup and Documentation

Use these resources to get going:

- [Growth Mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)
- [Markdown on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [Getting Started with GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)

## Requirements

1. Your site should exist at `https://USERNAME.github.io/reading-notes/`
1. The "source" for your site should include a README.md file, written in Markdown, that gives a description of your webpage. AND a index.html file, where you will add the following in HTML elements of your choice.
1. On the main page:
    - Explain "growth mindset" in your own words
    - Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
1. Utilize at least 5 different features of Markdown to structure your README page and at least 7 different HTML elements in your index.html
1. On your webpage, be sure to introduce yourself, and include a link to your GitHub page

### Stretch Goals

Beef up your webpage and github profile page! Add an image, a bio, contact info... as much as you feel comfortable including. Remember, these pages will be a showcase of your developer skills, so make it look great!

### Submission Instructions

Share a link to your live site below AND with your classmates in slack.

Then, review the sites of your classmates, comment with what you learned from them. Click through to their Github profile pages to "follow" each of your classmates.
